# Bank Loan Modelling - Unlocking a bank's growth opportunities through Loans by converting depositors into borrowers with Strategic Marketing

# Motivation
The financial industry, especially banking, is continuously evolving, and one of the key challenges faced by banks is optimizing their customer base to maximize revenue. The case study highlights a crucial business objective - expanding the pool of loan customers while retaining existing depositors. Achieving this goal can significantly enhance the bank's profitability by capitalizing on interest earnings from loans.

This projects aim to use available data for a specific bank customer base, transaction history, and past campaign results, to build predictive models to identify the most promising liability customers for conversion to personal loan customers. The project's primary motivation lies in developing an efficient and cost-effective marketing strategy through targeted campaigns.

The key areas of focus for the machine learning project include:

1. Predictive Analytics: Utilizing historical data, we can employ advanced algorithms to predict which liability customers are more likely to accept personal loan offers. This will enable the bank to tailor its marketing efforts, ensuring higher success rates and reducing the cost of customer acquisition.

2. Customer Segmentation: Employing unsupervised learning techniques, we can identify different customer segments based on their financial behavior, demographics, and preferences. This segmentation will allow Thera Bank to personalize marketing strategies for each group, optimizing the conversion process.

3. Budget Optimization: With limited marketing resources, it is crucial to allocate the budget wisely. Machine learning models can help identify the most promising campaigns, ensuring the bank achieves maximum return on investment.

4. Real-time Campaign Adaptation: By deploying machine learning models in real-time, the bank can dynamically adapt its marketing strategies based on customer responses, enhancing the campaign's overall effectiveness.

5. Business Growth: Successfully converting more liability customers into borrowers will not only lead to increased interest earnings but also expand the bank's loan business, making it more competitive in the market.

In conclusion, the machine learning project aims to empower Thera Bank with data-driven insights, enabling them to strategically target their marketing efforts and achieve significant growth in personal loan customers. By leveraging the power of machine learning, the bank can enhance its revenue streams, improve customer satisfaction, and stay ahead in the ever-changing financial landscape.

# Project Structure
The 'data' directory is where the dataset used for training and evaluation should be placed.

The 'models' directory is where the trained fraud detection model will be saved in a serialized format for future use.

The 'notebooks' directory contains the Jupyter Notebook bank_loan_modelling.ipynb, which demonstrates the step-by-step process of building and evaluating the fraud detection model.

The 'utils' directory includes helper functions and utilities used in the project, such as data processing and evaluation metrics.

# Results and Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify 

# Conclusion
This Project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to detect fraudulent activities in transactions. By developing an accurate fraud detection model, organizations can proactively identify and prevent potential losses.

Please refer to the bank_loan_modelling.ipynb notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the project implementation. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.

# Usage
To run the model, follow these steps:

Open the bank_loan_modelling.ipynb notebook located in the notebooks directory.

Execute the notebook cells in sequential order to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Optionally, adjust the hyperparameters or feature engineering techniques to improve the model's accuracy and performance.

After training, the model will be saved in the models directory as fraud_detection_model.pkl
